The caching GPU kernels part takes a WHILE for the 1st time.

6) train SAEHD.bat
set pre-train to off
change f to wf, use model options in train-model-summary.txt
p - update
train 100K iterations 

7) delete inter_AB.npy and train 100K more iterations (repeat a few times)

8) Copy model folder to new folder model-train-numtrainiters
