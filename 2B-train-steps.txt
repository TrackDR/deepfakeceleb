The caching GPU kernels part takes a WHILE for the 1st time.

6) train SAEHD.bat
set pre-train to off
change f to wf, use model options in train-model-summary.txt
p - update
train 100K iterations 

7) delete inter_AB.npy and train 100K more iterations (repeat a few times)

8) Copy model folder to new folder model-train-numtrainiters

9) train SAEHD.txt - random warp off, train 100K*n, deleting inter_AB.npy, saving model folder
10) train SAEHD.txt - gan 0.1, gan_dims:32, , train 100K*n, deleting inter_AB.npy, saving model folder

11) merge SAEHD.bat
interactive merger - n, maybe y
mode - (1) overlay
mask mode (4) learned-prd*learned-dst
color transfer mode: rct

interactive:
uses erode_mask (w) and blur_mask (e)
color-transfer mode mix-m
sharpen_mode: gaussian
blursharpen_amount: 1
erode_mask_modifier: 13
blur_mask_modifier: 80
motion_blur_power: 8

Check merged pngs

8) merged to .mp4 
Play merged .mp4 file
